**Brief Description**: This project is a metroidvania zombie first person shooter, inspired by the likes of Black Ops: Zombies and Metroid Prime. There will be a couple types of enemies the player must face with various weapons and collectable upgrades. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible and reach the end.

## Compliation/Deploy/Run
Unity has an inbuilt quick compiler so it is possible to open up the source files and run it directly in Unity. Also, under file you can click build to generate an executable for an operating system of your choice.
