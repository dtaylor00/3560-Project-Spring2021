Description:
This project is a metroidvania zombie first person shooter. There will be a couple types of enemies with weapons and upgrades that are collectable. There will be an end to the game.

Compliation/Deploy/Run
Unity has an inbuilt quick compiler so it is possible to open up the source files and run it directly in unity. Also, under file you can click build to generate an executable for an operating system of your choice.

Git
Are we using framework or library? If yes, what is it?  
Any tool for documentation?  
- We are currently not using tools for documentation. We are using XML comments.
