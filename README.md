**Brief Description**: This project is a metroidvania zombie first person shooter, inspired by the likes of Black Ops: Zombies and Metroid Prime. There will be a couple types of enemies the player must face with various weapons and collectable upgrades. The goal of the game is to survive as long as possible and reach the end.

## Compliation/Deploy/Run
Unity has an inbuilt quick compiler so it is possible to open up the source files and run it directly in Unity. Also, under file you can click build to generate an executable for an operating system of your choice.

What language are we leaning toward?  
- We will be using C# for this project.  
What would be an editor? Do we need an IDE?  
- Visual Studio and Unity, Yes  
What is the version control software (Git, Mercurial, or SVN)?  
- Git  
Are we using framework or library? If yes, what is it?  
Any tool for documentation?  
- We are currently not using tools for documentation. We are using XML comments.
Should there be a build system? Gradle, ant, npm etc?  
- We will be using Unity's inbuilt build system to build and run our project.
