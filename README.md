About This Project
-----------------------------  

### Unity Version: 2020.2.0f1
### Independent Assets Used: See bottom of README
  \
This project is a game built on the Unity game engine. It is a first-person shooter featuring elements of both metroidvania games and games such as Call of Duty Zombies. The player will fight their way through an expansive level gathering new weapons and power-ups to reach the goal.  
### Target Platform
The target platform is Desktop PCs, Mac, Linux and Windows. Unity makes it very easy to compile for all three of these systems so targeting all 3 is not a challenge.
### Compile Instructions
To compile the game, seeing you have the project file, simply open unity in the correct version, select `File -> Build Settings...` and select your desired platform. Then click `Build`. You will select a directory, the game will then build and be placed on your hard drive in the specified location to be played.
